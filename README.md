#Predicting Hospital Readmission for Diabetic Patients
---

## üéØOverview:
This project focuses on predicting hospital readmissions for diabetic patients using a historical medical claims dataset from U.S. hospitals. The primary goal is to identify the likelihood of patient readmission, with an aim to improve the quality of care, reduce unnecessary hospital visits, and minimize healthcare costs.

By leveraging patient data‚Äîsuch as lab results, administered medications, demographic information, and diagnosis codes.

The dataset, collected over ten years (1999‚Äì2008) from 130 U.S. hospitals, contains over 50 variables for inpatient diabetic encounters, including details on lab tests, medication history, and visit frequency.
Extracted 'Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008' dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes/data) using Kaggle API:

The final tuned model, while showing only modest improvements in accuracy, exhibits strong recall performance, which is particularly valuable in clinical settings where missing a high-risk patient can have serious consequences.

The results can empower healthcare professionals to:

- Target high-risk individuals for follow-up interventions

- Reduce hospital penalties and optimize resource allocation

- Improve the overall patient care journey and healthcare spending efficiency

With further refinement and integration into real-time clinical systems, such models can play a vital role in advancing value-based care and improving patient outcomes.
